# YOLOv8-Object-Detection
Real-time object detection using YOLOv8 and Python, used for BITSAuto.

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using YOLOv8 with a Python script and webcam input.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLO

## Setup
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python

This can be used with Rasberry pi as well, if required libraries are installed. The python code for this remains the same.
